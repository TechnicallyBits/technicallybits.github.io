# Technically Bits Privacy Policy
Last updated: September 2018
<br />

## Introduction
Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy describes how Technically Bits, LLC ("We") collect, use, and disclose user information gathered from our mobile apps and website. By using our apps and website, you agree to the collection and use of information described in this policy.
<br />

## What information do we obtain and how is it used?
### Information you provide us
If you choose to email us, we'll only use your email address to contact you. We will not sell or give your email address to any third party.

### Information we automatically collect

#### Website
Our website does not collect or log information about your visit. We do not track your activity through an analytics product or by any other means. However, as with most websites, our hosting services, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com), probably collects some basic information about your visit. This is likely to include your IP address and some information about your browser. We don't have access to that information.

#### Mobile Apps
Our apps do not collect analytics data. However, Apple may provide us with crash reports and statistics regarding your general use of our apps. We only receive this information if you have chosen to [share analytics, diagnostics, and usage information with Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202100). Apple collects this information anonymously. We use this information to get an idea of how many customers we have and where they're located. We do not sell or give this information to third parties.

#### OuOmoji
OuOmoji does **not** transmit anything you type to our servers. OuOmoji uses Full Access solely to allow the app to customize the appearance and content of the OuOmoji keyboard.

## Cookies
A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on your computer by your browser. We do not use cookies to track your online activity or behavior. Cookies may be used by other services that we use. Cloudflare may use cookies for security features as described [here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-What-does-the-Cloudflare-cfduid-cookie-do-).

## California Do Not Track Disclosure
Our website does not track visitors over time or across third-party websites for the purpose of showing targeted advertisements. Therefore, our website does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. In other words, we're not tracking you. Period. If you tell us not to track you, there's nothing for us to do.
<br />

## Individual choice and access
We currently do not offer a means to modify the collection, use, and sharing of personal information that we collect.
<br />

## Changes
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use of our apps or website is deemed approval of all changes.
